Build a production-ready iOS app with the following requirements:

Product

Create an iOS app called “SickDay Tracker” that helps users:

log quick daily health factors (sleep, stress, exercise, sugar, exposure, etc.)

track sickness episodes (cold/cough/fever/sinus/allergy/other)

view simple insights (counts, duration, symptom frequency, trigger patterns)

export a doctor-friendly PDF summary and CSV.

This app must not provide medical advice. Include an onboarding disclaimer.

Platform / Tech

Minimum iOS: iOS 17+

Language: Swift

UI: SwiftUI

Architecture: MVVM

Persistence: SwiftData (local only, no CloudKit/iCloud, no servers)

Charts: Swift Charts

PDF export: use native iOS PDF rendering (e.g., UIGraphicsPDFRenderer)

Local notifications: optional, only if cleanly implemented (no need for v1)

App Structure

Use a TabBar with 4 tabs:

Today

Episodes

Insights

Settings

Today tab

Show summary cards:

“Log Today” CTA

current logging streak

status of current episode (if one is active)

Daily log form fields (one per date; edit if exists):

date (default today)

sleep hours (0–12, step 0.25)

sleep quality (1–5)

stress (1–5)

exercise minutes (0–300) + type (walk/gym/yoga/other)

sugar intake (low/medium/high)

alcohol (none/some)

office day (yes/no)

sick contact exposure (yes/no)

humidifier used (yes/no)

notes (optional)

Ensure “one entry per date” constraint.

Episodes tab

List all episodes (most recent first)

Create/edit episode:

start date (required)

end date (optional until recovered)

type: cold/cough/fever/sinus/allergy/other

symptoms multi-select:

cough, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, fever, fatigue, body aches, headache

optional: mucus color (none/clear/yellow/green) with a note that color isn’t diagnostic

severity (1–5)

worst time: morning/night/all day

medications used (free-text tags)

doctor visit + test results (optional)

notes

Support “active episode” with no end date.

Prevent overlapping episodes (show warning; allow override with confirmation).

Insights tab

Provide non-medical insights (clear disclaimer):

episodes in last 30/90/365 days

average duration (exclude active episodes or treat as “ongoing”)

symptom frequency (bar chart)

episodes timeline (simple timeline view or chart)

“Potential triggers”:

For each episode, look at the 7 days before start date, compute averages/counts:

avg sleep hours

avg stress

total office days

total sick-contact days

humidifier usage days

Compare to baseline: last 60 days excluding episode windows

Display as simple comparisons (no causal claims).

Settings tab

Export:

PDF summary for last 90 days:

episode list + dates/durations

symptom frequency

key averages: sleep, stress, exercise, sugar distribution

CSV export for daily logs and episodes

App info:

privacy: “Data stays on device”

disclaimer: “Not medical advice”

Optional: “Reset all data” with confirmation.

UX / Accessibility

Clean, minimal UI; consistent spacing; calm typography.

Support Dynamic Type and VoiceOver labels for all interactive controls.

Avoid clutter. Prioritize speed of logging.

Data Model (SwiftData)

Define models with appropriate relationships and indexes:

DailyLog (unique by date)

SicknessEpisode (start/end, type, severity, symptoms, etc.)

Consider an enum or separate model for symptom selection storage.

GitHub Repo Requirements

Deliver a complete Xcode project ready to push to GitHub:

project builds cleanly with no manual steps

include .gitignore for Xcode

include README.md with:

overview

feature list

setup/build steps

privacy/disclaimer notes

screenshot placeholders

include LICENSE (MIT)

Testing

Add:

Unit tests for:

episode duration calculation

overlap detection

7-day trigger window aggregation

baseline computation excluding episode windows

UI tests for:

creating a daily log

creating an episode

exporting PDF (at least verify export action completes)

CI

Add GitHub Actions workflow that:

runs on push and PR

builds and runs tests via xcodebuild test on an iOS 17+ simulator

fails the build on warnings if feasible

Non-Functional

No analytics, no ads, no network calls.

App Store safe: no private APIs.

Include onboarding screen on first launch to acknowledge disclaimer + privacy statement.

Deliver:

full source code with MVVM

models, views, viewmodels, and services (PDF/CSV export)

tests

GitHub Actions workflow
